# Here you can specify how events are manipulated
# General format:
#
# <selector>:
#   move: "dependancy1, dependancy2, ..."
#   priority: <priority>
#   ignoresCancel: <true/false>
# 
# You must specify at least one of move, priority, or ignoresCancel.
#
# Dependancy format:
# before:PluginName
# after:PluginName
# PluginName can be * to mean all
# Priority is a normal event priority
#
# Selector format:
# <plugin>[<eventName>,<listenerClassName>,<priority>,<ignorescancel>]
# <plugin> is plugin name
# <listenerClassName> can be the name of the class(simple or full) the event is registered to or * to mean any
# <eventName> is the name of the event to manipulate. This can be the short or full name. Cannot be *
# <priority> normal event priority, or * for any
# <ignorescancel> true, false, or * for any
#
# Example:
#   Moves all AsyncPlayerChatEvents in the class with name "AntiChatRepeater" before all other handlers for that event
# 
# Pandora[AsyncPlayerChatEvent,AntiChatRepeater,*,*]:
#   move: "before:*"
#
# Example:
#   Changes the event priority from HIGHEST to LOWEST
#
# Pandora[AsyncPlayerChatEvent,AntiChatRepeater,HIGHEST,*]:
#   priority: LOWEST
